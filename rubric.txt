Creative Project Rubric 
For our creative project we will make a website that people can register to become users for, and will send a text at a specified date and time to their specified mobile device. You can add people to your friends and send them texts and a specified date and time as well. We will use flask and implement Twilio to complete this project. We chose flask because we wanted more experience with python.
